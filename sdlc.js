const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "The second step, which is getting the specific requirements of what needs to happen during the project so that the customer is getting exactly what they want.";
const design = "The third step is the designing process which takes employees from various parts of the company to make sure the plan and requirements is possible.";
const implementation = "The fourth step is building and implementing the plan and design of the project.";
const testingAndIntegration = "Testing the product is very important to see if there are issues that need to be redone, and to see which peices of the project are running smoothly.";
const maintain = "The final step after the product has been released. The maintenance on the project to keep up with user feedback and to keep all the software up to date.";
